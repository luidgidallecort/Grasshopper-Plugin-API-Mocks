# Grasshopper-Plugin-API-Mocks
Test API repository in JSON format for the development and integration of plugins for Grasshopper and Rhinoceros, as well as Desktop, Web, and Mobile applications that integrate functions in these plugins.

## About the Repository
This repository contains a collection of test APIs in JSON format, designed to assist in the development and integration of plugins for Grasshopper and Rhinoceros. Additionally, these APIs are useful for Desktop, Web, and Mobile applications that need to interact with these plugins.

## Objectives
- To facilitate the development and testing of plugins for Grasshopper/Rhinoceros.
- To provide a consistent test environment for Desktop, Web, and Mobile applications.
- To allow for the simulation of interactions with real APIs without the need for an active backend.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository to have local access to the test APIs.
- Use the 'Raw' URLs of the JSON files on GitHub for direct simulations in your application or plugin.
- Modify or add new JSON files as needed to meet the specific requirements of your project.

## Repository Structure
- `products.json`: Example API for products data.
- `users.json`: Example API for user data.
- (Add more files as needed).
